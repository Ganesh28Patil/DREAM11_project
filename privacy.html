                <p><strong>Use of Cookies:</strong></p>
                <p>To improve the effectiveness and usability of the Portal for our Users, we use "cookies", or such similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique random number as a User Identification (User ID) to understand
                    the User's individual interests using the identified computer. Unless the User voluntarily identifies himself/herself (e.g., through registration), Dream11 has no way of knowing who the User is, even if we assign a cookie to the User's
                    computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information supplied by the User. A cookie cannot read data off the User's hard drive. Dream11’s advertisers may also assign their own cookies to the User's browser (if
                    the User clicks on their ad banners), a process that Dream11 does not control.</p>
                <p>Dream11's web servers automatically collect limited information about User's computer's connection to the Internet, including User's IP address, when the User visits the Portal. (User's IP address is a number that lets computers attached
                    to the Internet know where to send data to the User -- such as the web pages viewed by the User). The User's IP address does not identify the User personally. Dream11 uses this information to deliver its web pages to Users upon request,
                    to tailor its Portal to the interests of its users, to measure traffic within the Portal and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where Dream11's visitors come.</p>
                <p><strong>Links:</strong></p>
                <p>Dream11 also includes links to other websites. Such websites are governed by their respective privacy policies, which are beyond Dream11's control. Once the User leaves Dream11's servers (the User can tell where he/she is by checking the
                    URL in the location bar on the User's browser), use of any information provided by the User is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site which the User is visiting. That policy may differ from Dream11's own. If the
                    User can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, the User may contact the site directly for more information. Dream11 is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such
                    websites.</p>
                <p><strong>Security Procedures:</strong></p>
                <p>All information gathered on Dream11 is securely stored within Dream11- controlled database. The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to such servers being password-protected and strictly limited based on need-to-know
                    basis. However, we understand that as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. Thus, we cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be
                    intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. Further, any information you include in a posting to the discussion areas will be available to anyone with Internet access. By using the Portal, you understand and agree
