            What are flexible contests?
            
          </h1></h1>
        <p>
            Flexible contests are private contests that don't get cancelled even if only two teams join. Yes, that's correct. 😀
        </p>
        
            <p>When you create a private contest and make it a 'Flexible Contest' to ensure:</p>
        
        <p>
            ✅ The contest takes place even if just two teams join (no cancellation even if all spots don't fill up)

        </p>
        <p>
            ✅ The Prize Pool for the contest keeps increasing as more and more teams join
