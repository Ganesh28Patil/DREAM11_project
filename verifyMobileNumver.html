        <h1> I see a 'Verify Mobile Number' message every time I try to log in. What should I do now?</h1>
        <p>
            You see this message because you've not registered your mobile number on Dream11 yet. 
        </p>
        <p>
            ✅ Please enter your mobile number, and you'll get an OTP. Enter the OTP, and you'll be able to log in seamlessly, just like before.
        </p>
        <p>
            👉 If you see an error 'The number is already registered,' this means the number you're trying to enter is already registered on Dream11. Please enter a number that is not linked to any other Dream11 account, you'll get an OTP, and once you enter that, you'll be able to log in just like before. 👍

        </p>
        <p>
            PS: You won't be able to skip this screen - you'll have to verify your mobile number to log in. 🙌
